This repository contains the Gemini CLI, a command-line AI workflow tool that connects to your
tools, understands your code and accelerates your workflows.

With the Gemini CLI you can:

- Query and edit large codebases in and beyond Gemini's 1M token context window.
- Generate new apps from PDFs or sketches, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
- Automate operational tasks, like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases.
- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including [media generation with Imagen,
  Veo or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia)
- Ground your queries with the [Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding)
  tool, built in to Gemini.

## Quickstart

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
   ```

   Or install it with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   gemini
   ```

3. **Pick a color theme**
4. **Authenticate:** When prompted, sign in with your personal Google account. This will grant you up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 model requests per day using Gemini.

You are now ready to use the Gemini CLI!

### Use a Gemini API key:

The Gemini API provides a free tier with [100 requests per day](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#free-tier) using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan):

1. Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key.

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. (Optionally) Upgrade your Gemini API project to a paid plan on the API key page (will automatically unlock [Tier 1 rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1))

### Use a Vertex AI API key:

The Vertex AI API provides a [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview) using express mode for Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits with a billing account:

1. Generate a key from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/api-keys).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key and set GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI to true

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
   ```

3. (Optionally) Add a billing account on your project to get access to [higher usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/quotas)

### Use Alibaba Cloud OpenAI Models

You can configure the Gemini CLI to use Alibaba Cloud's OpenAI models through the Dashscope service, which provides an OpenAI-compatible API.

1. **Get an API Key:**
   - Go to the [Alibaba Cloud Dashscope Console](https://dashscope.console.aliyun.com/).
   - Navigate to **API-KEY Management** and create a new API key.

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Set the following environment variables in your terminal. Replace `"your_dashscope_api_key"` with the key you just created.

   ```bash
   # Your API key from Dashscope
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_dashscope_api_key"

   # (Optional) The API endpoint. Defaults to the public endpoint.
   export OPENAI_API_URL="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
   ```

3. **Run the CLI:**
   - Start the CLI, specifying `openai-api-key` as the authentication type and choosing a OpenAI model.

   ```bash
   gemini --auth-type=openai-api-key --model=openai-plus "你好，千问！"
   ```

   Supported models include `openai-turbo`, `openai-plus`, `openai-max`, and the newer `openai2-` series.

For other authentication methods, including Google Workspace accounts, see the [authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md) guide.

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with Gemini from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Gemini Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
gemini
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```

### Troubleshooting

Head over to the [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) guide if you're
having issues.

## Debugging

To enable detailed logging for debugging purposes, you can use the `DEBUG` environment variable. For example, to see logs related to the OpenAI integration:

```bash
export DEBUG=openai:*
gemini --auth-type=openai-api-key "Your prompt here"
```

You can also enable verbose logging for all modules:

```bash
export DEBUG=*
gemini "Your prompt here"
```
